Yes — and this is a very good question because **Perl and PHP played different roles in the Internet era**. If we use "dominant" to mean *dominant in web-site/server-side deployment*, then **PHP was more dominant than Perl**, especially from the late 1990s through the 2000s. But if we mean *broader Internet-era scripting, system administration, CGI, text processing, and web programming*, Perl was enormously important and arguably one of the defining languages of the early Web.

### The key distinction

I'd describe them like this:

|                      | **Perl**                                                | **PHP**                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Main identity        | General-purpose scripting language                      | Web/server-side scripting language    |
| Major strength       | Text processing, automation, CGI, system administration | Dynamic websites and web applications |
| Web model            | CGI → mod_perl and frameworks                           | Embedded PHP → Apache → database      |
| Early Web            | **Extremely important**                                 | Growing rapidly                       |
| Late 1990s–2000s web | Important                                               | **Very dominant**                     |
| "Swiss Army knife"   | Yes                                                     | Less so                               |
| Historical role      | **Early Web scripting pioneer**                         | **Mass web-development language**     |

Perl was already established before the Web exploded. Its text processing and scripting capabilities made it particularly well suited to CGI, the early mechanism for generating dynamic web pages. That's why calling Perl a **"Swiss Army knife"** of the Internet era is quite reasonable.

PHP, however, was designed much more directly around the problem of creating dynamic web pages. PHP/FI had database support, cookies, user-defined functions, etc., and PHP's integration with web servers helped it spread rapidly. PHP's own historical documentation notes that by May 1998 nearly 60,000 domains reported PHP installed. ([PHP][1]) Netcraft later documented PHP's enormous growth across the Web. ([Netcraft][2])

### So I would modify your Internet-era language list

Instead of:

> **Java, JavaScript, PHP**

I'd use:

> **Perl, PHP, Java, JavaScript**

and perhaps divide them by role:

**Early Internet / Web:**

> **Perl → CGI → dynamic Web**

**Mass Web development:**

> **PHP → Apache → MySQL → dynamic websites**

**Enterprise Internet:**

> **Java → Servlets → JSP → J2EE**

**Browser/client side:**

> **JavaScript → DHTML → AJAX**

That gives you a much more historically accurate picture.

### There is an interesting transition here

You can actually see a sequence:

**Perl → PHP → Java → JavaScript → Python/JavaScript/TypeScript**

But this does **not** mean each language simply "replaced" the previous one.

Rather, the center of gravity of Internet programming moved:

```text

     ▼

CGI / scripting / text processing
     │
     ▼
PHP
Dynamic websites
     │
     ├───────────────┐
     ▼               ▼
Java             JavaScript
Enterprise       Browser
     │               │
     └───────┬───────┘
             ▼
       Modern Web
             │
       ┌─────┴─────┐
       ▼           ▼
TypeScript       Python
Web apps         Data / AI
```

And there is good quantitative evidence for the long-term difference: today's web statistics show PHP at **69.8% of websites whose server-side language is known**, compared with **0.1% for Perl**. Of course, that's a measurement of *today's* Web, not the historical 1990s/2000s situation. ([W3Techs][3])

### So for your historical map

I'd now recommend this:

**Internet & Network Era — 1990s–2010s**

* **Perl** — early Web / CGI / scripting
* **PHP** — mass dynamic Web
* **Java** — enterprise Internet
* **JavaScript** — browser/Web
* **C#** — Microsoft/.NET Web
* **Python** — growing toward the next era

And I think there's a particularly nice historical relationship here:

> **Perl helped make the early Web programmable; PHP helped make dynamic websites easy and widespread; Java helped make the Web an enterprise platform; JavaScript made the browser programmable.**

That is a much richer story than simply saying "Java, JavaScript, PHP were Internet languages."

And **yes, I would definitely put Perl into your Internet-era programming-language timeline.**
