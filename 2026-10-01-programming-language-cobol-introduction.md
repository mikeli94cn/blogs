**COBOL** is one of the most important early high-level programming languages, especially for **business, banking, government, and large-scale data processing**.

The name stands for:

> **CO**mmon **B**usiness-**O**riented **L**anguage

If Fortran represents the rise of **scientific programming**, COBOL represents the rise of **business data processing**.

A useful historical contrast is:

```text
FORTRAN
   ↓
scientific + mathematical computing

COBOL
   ↓
business + commercial data processing
```

---

## 1. Why was COBOL created?

In the 1950s, computers were increasingly being used not only for scientific calculations but also for business operations:

* payroll
* accounting
* banking
* insurance
* inventory
* government records
* customer accounts
* transaction processing

These problems are somewhat different from scientific computing.

For example, a business might need to process:

```text
Customer ID
Customer Name
Account Number
Balance
Transaction
Address
Date
```

The program needs to manipulate **large amounts of structured data**, rather than primarily calculate mathematical formulas.

COBOL was designed for exactly this kind of work.

---

# 2. History of COBOL

COBOL emerged around **1959**.

One of the major people associated with its development was **Grace Hopper**.

The U.S. Department of Defense was an important force behind its standardization and adoption.

The historical environment was roughly:

```text
1950s
       ┌───────────────┐
       │   Computers   │
       └───────┬───────┘
               │
       ┌───────┴────────┐
       │                │
 scientific          business
       │                │
    FORTRAN           COBOL
```

This is an important distinction in early programming-language history.

---

# 3. COBOL's main design goal

COBOL wanted programs to be relatively understandable to people who were not computer specialists.

For example:

```cobol
ADD PRICE TO TOTAL.
```

or:

```cobol
MOVE CUSTOMER-NAME TO DISPLAY-NAME.
```

This is quite different from assembly language:

```text
LOAD
ADD
STORE
...
```

The idea was:

> **Business programs should describe business operations in a form that humans can understand.**

This was a very important idea for software engineering.

---

# 4. A simple COBOL program

A traditional COBOL program looks unusual to someone accustomed to Java, C, or Python.

For example:

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. HELLO.

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           DISPLAY "HELLO, WORLD!".
           STOP RUN.
```

Output:

```text
HELLO, WORLD!
```

The structure is deliberately very explicit.

---

# 5. COBOL's four major divisions

Traditional COBOL programs are organized into **four divisions**:

```text
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION
        ↓
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION
        ↓
DATA DIVISION
        ↓
PROCEDURE DIVISION
```

This is one of the first things to understand when learning COBOL.

---

## 5.1 IDENTIFICATION DIVISION

Describes the program itself.

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. CUSTOMER-PROGRAM.
```

Think of it roughly as:

```text
program metadata
```

---

## 5.2 ENVIRONMENT DIVISION

Describes the program's relationship with its execution environment.

Historically this was particularly important because programs interacted with specific hardware and files.

For example:

```cobol
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
CONFIGURATION SECTION.
```

Modern COBOL programs may use much less of this than older programs.

---

## 5.3 DATA DIVISION

Defines the data used by the program.

For example:

```cobol
DATA DIVISION.
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.

01 CUSTOMER-NAME PIC X(30).
01 CUSTOMER-AGE  PIC 9(3).
01 BALANCE       PIC 9(7)V99.
```

This is an extremely important part of COBOL.

---

## 5.4 PROCEDURE DIVISION

Contains the actual operations:

```cobol
PROCEDURE DIVISION.

    DISPLAY CUSTOMER-NAME.
    DISPLAY BALANCE.

    STOP RUN.
```

You can roughly compare it with the executable part of a Java program.

---

# 6. COBOL's data model

One of COBOL's distinctive features is its strong emphasis on **business data**.

For example:

```cobol
01 CUSTOMER-RECORD.
    05 CUSTOMER-ID       PIC 9(8).
    05 CUSTOMER-NAME     PIC X(30).
    05 CUSTOMER-BALANCE  PIC 9(7)V99.
```

This describes a hierarchical record:

```text
CUSTOMER-RECORD
│
├── CUSTOMER-ID
├── CUSTOMER-NAME
└── CUSTOMER-BALANCE
```

This is very natural for business records.

---

# 7. What is `PIC`?

You will frequently see something like:

```cobol
PIC X(30)
```

or:

```cobol
PIC 9(10)
```

`PIC` means **PICTURE**.

It describes the representation of the data.

For example:

```cobol
PIC X(30)
```

means approximately:

```text
30 characters
```

while:

```cobol
PIC 9(5)
```

means:

```text
5 numeric digits
```

And:

```cobol
PIC 9(7)V99
```

represents a numeric value with:

```text
7 digits before the decimal point
2 digits after it
```

The `V` represents an **implied decimal point**.

So this could represent:

```text
1234567.89
```

This kind of precise data description was very useful for financial applications.

---

# 8. COBOL is very good at records

Suppose a bank has:

```text
Account
 ├── Account Number
 ├── Customer Name
 ├── Address
 ├── Balance
 └── Status
```

COBOL lets you represent that structure directly:

```cobol
01 ACCOUNT-RECORD.
    05 ACCOUNT-NUMBER PIC X(12).
    05 CUSTOMER-NAME  PIC X(40).
    05 ADDRESS        PIC X(60).
    05 BALANCE        PIC 9(9)V99.
    05 STATUS         PIC X.
```

This is one reason COBOL became so successful in business systems.

---

# 9. COBOL and files

COBOL was designed for large-scale data processing.

A program might:

```text
read customer records
        ↓
process record
        ↓
calculate something
        ↓
write updated record
        ↓
read next record
        ↓
...
```

Historically, this was especially important when data was stored on:

* magnetic tape
* disk files
* sequential files
* indexed files

A simplified COBOL file-processing program might look conceptually like:

```cobol
OPEN INPUT CUSTOMER-FILE.

PERFORM UNTIL END-OF-FILE
    READ CUSTOMER-FILE
        AT END
            MOVE "Y" TO END-OF-FILE
        NOT AT END
            DISPLAY CUSTOMER-NAME
    END-READ
END-PERFORM.

CLOSE CUSTOMER-FILE.
```

This style of **batch processing** became one of COBOL's major strengths.

---

# 10. COBOL and business logic

COBOL is particularly expressive for business operations.

For example:

```cobol
IF BALANCE > 1000
    DISPLAY "PREMIUM CUSTOMER"
ELSE
    DISPLAY "NORMAL CUSTOMER"
END-IF.
```

Arithmetic:

```cobol
ADD DEPOSIT TO BALANCE.
SUBTRACT WITHDRAWAL FROM BALANCE.
MULTIPLY PRICE BY QUANTITY GIVING TOTAL.
```

You can see why the language was attractive to business programmers.

---

# 11. COBOL vs Fortran

This is probably the most useful comparison given your previous question.

|                             | Fortran                           | COBOL                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Main purpose                | Scientific computing              | Business computing           |
| Created                     | 1950s                             | 1950s                        |
| Famous domain               | Physics, mathematics, engineering | Banking, finance, government |
| Main data                   | Numbers, arrays                   | Records, transactions        |
| Important operation         | Numerical calculation             | Data processing              |
| Style                       | Mathematical                      | Business-oriented            |
| Typical historical hardware | Scientific computers              | Business/mainframe systems   |

You can remember:

```text
FORTRAN
    ↓
FORMULA
    ↓
SCIENCE

COBOL
    ↓
BUSINESS
    ↓
RECORDS + TRANSACTIONS
```

---

# 12. COBOL vs C

Later, **C** became extremely influential.

But C came from a different direction.

```text
COBOL
   ↓
business applications
   ↓
data + records + transactions

C
   ↓
systems programming
   ↓
memory + hardware + operating systems
```

So the early history of high-level languages wasn't simply:

```text
Fortran → COBOL → C
```

It was more like **different branches developing for different problems**.

---

# 13. COBOL and mainframes

COBOL became strongly associated with **mainframe computing**, especially IBM mainframes and later systems such as IBM Z.

A simplified historical architecture looks like:

```text
                Mainframe
                    │
        ┌───────────┴───────────┐
        │                       │
     COBOL                    Other
        │
        ↓
Business applications
        │
 ┌──────┼────────┬──────────┐
 ↓      ↓        ↓          ↓
Banking Payroll Insurance Government
```

This is why people sometimes associate COBOL almost exclusively with "old mainframe computers."

But the reality is more nuanced: **COBOL itself has continued to evolve**, and modern COBOL implementations can interact with newer technologies.

---

# 14. Why hasn't COBOL disappeared?

This is probably the most interesting question.

You might expect:

```text
1959 COBOL
     ↓
1969
     ↓
1979
     ↓
1989
     ↓
1999
     ↓
2009
     ↓
2029
```

to mean that COBOL should have disappeared.

But many organizations built enormous systems around COBOL.

Imagine a bank with:

```text
10,000,000 lines of COBOL
        +
40 years of business rules
        +
millions of customer records
        +
integration with other systems
```

Replacing everything would be extremely expensive and risky.

Therefore, many organizations continue to **maintain, modernize, integrate, and gradually replace** COBOL systems rather than simply throwing them away.

---

# 15. COBOL's relationship with databases

Modern business systems frequently involve databases.

Historically, however, COBOL was already heavily involved in **record-oriented data processing** before today's relational database ecosystem became dominant.

Modern COBOL applications can also work with databases such as:

```text
COBOL
  │
  ├── DB2
  ├── SQL
  └── other database systems
```

For example, a banking application might conceptually look like:

```text
Java / Web application
        ↓
     API layer
        ↓
   COBOL service
        ↓
      DB2
        ↓
 customer/account data
```

This kind of coexistence is common in large enterprise environments.

---

# 16. COBOL and Java

Since you're learning Java backend development, this comparison is useful.

A modern system might have:

```text
                 Web browser
                     │
                     ↓
                Spring Boot
                     │
                     ↓
               REST API
                     │
                     ↓
                COBOL system
                     │
                     ↓
                   DB2
```

So learning Java does not necessarily mean you will never encounter COBOL.

Large enterprise systems can contain **multiple generations of technology**:

```text
COBOL
  +
mainframe
  +
DB2
  +
Java
  +
Spring
  +
REST
  +
cloud
```

The old and new systems can coexist.

---

# 17. COBOL's historical importance

For your programming-language history study, I'd summarize COBOL's contribution as:

> **COBOL demonstrated that programming languages could be designed around business concepts and large-scale data processing rather than around the hardware or mathematical computation.**

This is an important step in the evolution of abstraction.

You can visualize the progression:

```text
Machine language
       ↓
"How does the CPU execute this?"
       ↓
Assembly
       ↓
"How do I control the machine?"
       ↓
Fortran
       ↓
"How do I express this mathematical calculation?"
       ↓
COBOL
       ↓
"How do I express this business operation?"
       ↓
Modern languages
       ↓
"How do I model the application/domain?"
```

That is a very useful way to understand why COBOL mattered.

---

# 18. Fortran and COBOL as two major early branches

If you're building a **history of programming languages**, I would place these two languages side by side:

```text
                 High-level languages
                         │
             ┌───────────┴───────────┐
             │                       │
        Scientific                 Business
             │                       │
          FORTRAN                  COBOL
             │                       │
      Mathematics                 Records
      Engineering                Transactions
      Physics                    Banking
      Simulation                 Accounting
             │                       │
             └───────────┬───────────┘
                         ↓
              Modern application
                  programming
```

And then another important branch appears:

```text
                         Early
                    high-level languages
                           │
        ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
        ↓                  ↓                  ↓
     FORTRAN              COBOL             ALGOL
        │                  │                  │
    scientific          business          algorithms
        │                  │                  │
        ↓                  ↓                  ↓
       HPC             Enterprise       language design
```

**Fortran → scientific computing**, **COBOL → business computing**, and **ALGOL → algorithmic/language-design influence** are three particularly useful pieces of the early history.

That makes COBOL a very good language to study even if you never intend to become a COBOL programmer.
