**Fortran** is one of the oldest high-level programming languages and was the first widely successful language designed specifically to make **scientific and numerical programming** easier.

The name originally came from **FORmula TRANslator**.

If we look at programming-language history, Fortran is extremely important because it represents one of the first major steps from **assembly language → high-level programming**.

---

## 1. What is Fortran?

Fortran is a **compiled, imperative, general-purpose programming language**, with a particularly strong tradition in:

* numerical computation
* scientific computing
* engineering
* physics
* mathematics
* weather and climate simulation
* high-performance computing (HPC)
* large-scale numerical simulations

A tiny Fortran program looks like:

```fortran
program Hello
    print *, "Hello, World!"
end program Hello
```

Compile and run:

```bash
gfortran hello.f90 -o hello
./hello
```

Output:

```text
Hello, World!
```

The modern compiler most commonly encountered on Linux is **GNU Fortran (`gfortran`)**.

---

# 2. Why was Fortran created?

Before Fortran, programmers often had to write scientific programs in:

```text
machine language
      ↓
assembly language
```

Suppose a scientist wanted to calculate:

$$
y = ax + b
$$

In assembly, this could require many low-level instructions.

The idea behind Fortran was revolutionary:

> **Let scientists express mathematical formulas directly in a programming language, and let a compiler translate them into machine code.**

For example:

```fortran
y = a*x + b
```

The programmer doesn't need to manually write the corresponding machine instructions.

This was one of the fundamental ideas that made **high-level programming languages** practical.

---

# 3. History of Fortran

Fortran was developed at **IBM** under the leadership of **John Backus**.

The first version appeared in the **1950s**, with the first commercial release generally associated with **1957**.

A simplified timeline is:

```text
1940s
  │
  ├── Machine language
  │
1950s
  │
  ├── Assembly language
  │
  ├── FORTRAN I  ← 1957
  │
1960s
  │
  ├── FORTRAN II
  ├── FORTRAN IV
  │
1970s
  │
  ├── FORTRAN 77
  │
1990s
  │
  ├── Fortran 90
  │
2000s
  │
  ├── Fortran 2003
  ├── Fortran 2008
  │
2010s
  │
  ├── Fortran 2018
  │
2020s
  │
  └── Fortran 2023
```

The capitalization gradually changed from the historical **FORTRAN** to the modern **Fortran**.

---

# 4. The most important idea: formula translation

The original purpose of Fortran can be understood from its name:

> **FORmula TRANslator**

Consider a mathematical expression:

$$
x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

In Fortran:

```fortran
x = (-b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
```

Notice how close the program is to the mathematical formula.

This was a major breakthrough.

Compare the conceptual progression:

```text
Machine language
      ↓
Assembly
      ↓
FORTRAN
      ↓
High-level mathematical expression
```

The programmer increasingly works with **ideas rather than hardware instructions**.

---

# 5. Basic Fortran syntax

## Variables

```fortran
program Variables

    integer :: age
    real :: height
    character(len=20) :: name

    age = 25
    height = 1.75
    name = "Alice"

    print *, age
    print *, height
    print *, name

end program Variables
```

Common types include:

```text
integer
real
double precision
complex
logical
character
```

Fortran is particularly strong at numerical data types.

---

# 6. Arithmetic

Fortran's arithmetic notation is quite natural:

```fortran
a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
a ** b
```

The interesting one is:

```fortran
a ** b
```

which means exponentiation.

For example:

```fortran
x = 2 ** 10
```

gives:

```text
1024
```

---

# 7. Arrays

Arrays are one of Fortran's greatest strengths.

```fortran
program ArrayExample

    integer :: a(5)

    a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

    print *, a

end program ArrayExample
```

Modern Fortran even supports convenient array operations.

For example:

```fortran
integer :: a(5)
integer :: b(5)
integer :: c(5)

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

c = a + b
```

Now:

```text
c = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55]
```

You don't necessarily need to write a loop yourself.

This is particularly useful for **scientific computing**.

---

# 8. Loops

Traditional loop:

```fortran
integer :: i

do i = 1, 10
    print *, i
end do
```

Output:

```text
1
2
3
...
10
```

This is similar conceptually to:

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

---

# 9. Conditions

For example:

```fortran
if (x > 0) then
    print *, "positive"
else if (x < 0) then
    print *, "negative"
else
    print *, "zero"
end if
```

So the fundamental control structures are familiar:

```text
sequence
   ↓
selection       → if
   ↓
iteration       → do
   ↓
procedure       → subroutine/function
```

---

# 10. Functions

Fortran supports functions:

```fortran
function square(x) result(y)

    real :: x
    real :: y

    y = x * x

end function square
```

You can then use:

```fortran
result = square(5.0)
```

Fortran also has **subroutines**:

```fortran
subroutine print_message()
    print *, "Hello"
end subroutine print_message
```

---

# 11. Modules

Modern Fortran has a module system:

```fortran
module MathUtils

contains

    function square(x) result(y)
        real :: x
        real :: y

        y = x * x
    end function square

end module MathUtils
```

Then another program can use it:

```fortran
program Main

    use MathUtils

    print *, square(5.0)

end program Main
```

This provides a way to organize large programs.

---

# 12. Fortran and scientific computing

This is where Fortran becomes particularly interesting.

Suppose you have a huge matrix:

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Fortran has powerful built-in support for multidimensional arrays.

```fortran
real :: A(1000, 1000)

A = 0.0
```

You can also perform operations on whole arrays.

For example:

```fortran
A = A * 2.0
```

This is conceptually:

$$
A_{ij} = 2A_{ij}
$$

for every element.

This style is extremely convenient for numerical algorithms.

---

# 13. Why is Fortran still used?

This is an interesting question because Fortran is **very old**, but it hasn't disappeared.

Fortran remains important in areas such as:

```text
Scientific computing
      │
      ├── Physics
      ├── Chemistry
      ├── Mathematics
      ├── Engineering
      ├── Weather simulation
      ├── Climate modeling
      ├── Computational fluid dynamics
      ├── Astronomy
      └── High-performance computing
```

One major reason is that there is an enormous amount of existing scientific software written in Fortran.

Also, modern Fortran has evolved considerably. It isn't simply the FORTRAN of the 1950s.

---

# 14. Fortran's relationship with C

Fortran and C emerged from different needs.

### Fortran

Primarily:

```text
mathematics
   ↓
scientific computation
   ↓
numerical performance
```

### C

Primarily:

```text
systems programming
   ↓
operating systems
   ↓
hardware-oriented software
```

This gives an interesting historical division:

| Language | Historical strength              |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Fortran  | Scientific/numerical programming |
| C        | Systems programming              |
| COBOL    | Business/data processing         |
| Lisp     | Symbolic/AI research             |
| ALGOL    | Algorithmic language design      |
| Simula   | Simulation + OOP                 |

These languages helped establish several different branches of programming.

---

# 15. Fortran and C++/Java

Fortran is quite different from Java.

For example, Java emphasizes:

```text
classes
objects
interfaces
inheritance
encapsulation
garbage collection
```

Fortran traditionally emphasizes:

```text
numbers
arrays
functions
subroutines
mathematical operations
numerical performance
```

Modern Fortran does support object-oriented programming, but **OOP was not the original center of the language**.

---

# 16. Fortran's historical importance

For your study of programming-language history, I think this is the most important part.

You can think of the early history like this:

```text
Machine language
      │
      │  hardware instructions
      ▼
Assembly
      │
      │  symbolic machine instructions
      ▼
FORTRAN
      │
      │  mathematical formulas
      ▼
High-level programming
```

Fortran demonstrated something fundamental:

> **A compiler can translate a high-level description of a problem into efficient machine code.**

This was a huge conceptual shift.

Before high-level languages, programming was closely tied to the computer's architecture.

After languages such as Fortran, programmers could increasingly think in terms of:

```text
mathematical formulas
algorithms
data
procedures
```

rather than:

```text
registers
opcodes
memory addresses
machine instructions
```

---

# 17. Fortran's place in your programming-language timeline

You previously proposed a timeline roughly like:

```text
1945–1955   Assembly
1955–1970   Fortran
1970–1985   C
1985–1995   C++
1995–2010   JavaScript
2010–2025   TypeScript
2025–       Python
```

I'd refine the **early part** somewhat:

```text
1940s
    Machine language
        ↓
1950s
    Assembly
        ↓
    FORTRAN
        ↓
    Lisp
        ↓
1960s
    ALGOL
        ↓
    COBOL
        ↓
    Simula
        ↓
1970s
    C
        ↓
1980s
    C++
        ↓
1990s
    Java
    JavaScript
        ↓
2000s
    C#
    Python grows
        ↓
2010s
    JavaScript / TypeScript
    Python
        ↓
2020s
    Python
    JavaScript/TypeScript
    Java
    C/C++
    Rust
    Go
    ...
```

The important point is that **there wasn't one language replacing another**. Different languages developed around different programming problems.

And Fortran is a great example: **a language can be decades old and still be technologically relevant because its problem domain remains important.**

### A useful way to remember Fortran

> **FORTRAN = the language that made mathematical formulas programmable.**

And historically:

> **Fortran is one of the foundational languages that established compiled high-level programming.**
